## **Beta Factory**

Airplanes contain array of constant size which represent airplane capacity.
`AirplaneFactory` produces different airplanes and `TicketFactory` uses `Airplane`
to produce new `Ticket`; Ticket contains `seat` and `price`. Passengers themselves are just names and tickets.

I haven't finished this package yet because it's boring =)
